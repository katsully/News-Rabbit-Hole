Susanne Gibson~www.vox.com~http://vox.com/e/7032638?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=article-share-top~But the larger problem with the cartoon is that it seems oblivious to the meaning of the Thanksgiving holiday. Remember, the classic Thanksgiving story is about Pilgrims — a.k.a. immigrants — who showed up on American shores uninvited, and in precarious economic circumstances. Thanksgiving is a celebration of the fact that the native-born Americans who lived in the area welcomed these newcomers, shared their food with them, and helped them make the transition to their new home.

Over the next four centuries, the United States followed the example of those native Americans, welcoming wave after wave of immigrants from countries all over the planet. Almost everyone in America today is descended from some of those immigrants.

Can we please be more PC, please...? Get over it. It's no longer 1776, 1850, 1915, etc... Melting pot, sure. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry's meal ticket? F-that...

What is the artist being racist about? People with mustaches climbing through windows...?

My wife and I are "rich" because we bothered to get an education and jobs where we can provide for our family...? Whatever fat, dumb, and happy legislator thought that made sense, clearly got through college off of mommy and daddy's check book. 

I'm kinda tired of the bleeding hearts, and the "holier-than-thou's"... 

If you wanna be here, great, we're happy to have you. But don't look for, or expect any (undeserving) special handout. 

Unfortunately, if you want "all that's good" out of this place, you gotta be willing to deal with all the bullshit too... Just like all the rest of us working class slobs...

So in short, to all those who were "offended" by this... get off your high horse. This cartoon is no more racist, or polarizing (in any other fashion) than any other political cartoon that has ever been published. (Actually, I'd be willing to bet that this one is tame compared to some that had been published in the past...)

Jimmy L. Capps~I am so disappointed... I could not get any response on my politically motivated immigration cartoons.. You people let me down. It really makes you feel worthless when you can't even infuriate anyone.   So I deleted them....  just see if I take the time and effort to insult anyone again!

Elizabeth Santoyo~The Indianapolis Star on Saturday said it "erred" in publishing a cartoon that depicted undocumented immigrants crashing a white family's Thanksgiving dinner.

Steve Bonzai~Guys, I absolutely support #ImmigrationAction and #CIR.

There are a lot of great memes, a lot of strong images that make the case for it.

But I cannot see another cartoon with a Native American scowling at a pack of angry white conservatives with the punchline basically saying, "Tell me about it."

You know which ones I mean. The guy waving an American Flag and yelling at a Latino, "Get off my land." Then, the same guy getting an earful from a Native American with arms crossed. Ah, the irony!

We were immigrants once. And we were lousy visitors who kicked out the original tenants.

We were terrible then. But we're also about to be terrible now... and we can still stop THAT.

By helping Native Americans keep #KeystoneXL off tribal lands.

I am in not ignoring the hypocrisy of "get off my land."  But it'd sure be nice to not see cartoons 20 years from now with Native Americans covered in oil and goo saying, "Tell Me About It."~https://www.facebook.com/TheMarmelPage/photos/a.217259448301136.70251.216484961711918/1028501887176884/?type=1

Mark Kessinger~Emperor's New Clothes cartoon: http://blogs.post-gazette.com/opinion/rob-rogers-cartoons/42961-emperor-s-new-clothes #Obama #immigration  #mitchmcconell #GOP~https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152661952802562&set=a.86014117561.84828.549542561&type=1~The GOP has managed to create a real problem for itself on this issue.  For years, it has intentionally stoked the rage of its most extreme racist and xenophobic elements.  In so doing, they have managed to newly confer a measure of social respectability for blatant bigotries of all sorts, such that even folks who once might have kept their expressions of prejudice in check for fear of social disapproval are now perfectly comfortable expressing even the most outrrageous bigotries overtly and unapologetically.   So after years of pouring gasoline on a fire, the GOP has managed to create a base that is almost universally of the "deport 'em all" mindset.  

 I suspect that most of the Republican Congress critters know perfectly well how absurdly unrealistic is the notion of deporting upwards of 12 million people, and they certainly understand that given the ongoing demographic shifts in this country,, it is ultimately politically suicidal to call for such deportations.  But their bigoted base demands it..  I think what has Republicans in Congress so outraged about the President's executive action is that it boxes them in politically, forcing Republicans to declare themselves on the issue, and thus denying them any room to work both sides of the (border) fence.  What Congressional Republicans really want here is the ability to continue taking no action on immigration one way or the other, so they can avoid offending their base while still purporting to engage in "outreach" to Latino voters. 

As a political maneuver, I have to hand it to Obama on this one:  a stroke of political genius!
