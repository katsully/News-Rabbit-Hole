Rita Fullmer Breton~From our 2013 Alaska polar bear photo tour; I wrote the music, played the guitar, shot almost all the video and (sloppily) edited the clip. A couple of the clips were filmed by some of the clients on the tour. Feel free to share and repost; polar bears need all the publicity we can give them. Hope you enjoy it. Cheers.~https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10152191514236726~I MISS ALASKA
