Susan Sollecito~President Obama's address tonight wasn't about an immigration solution.  It was a power grab -- the President paving the way toward more unconstitutional executive actions that are sure to come.

"So, in other words, they published a cartoon drawn by an anti-immigrant racist, and are only sorry because they got called out for it on social media. That’s the thing about these non-apologies: they just make matters worse. Mr. Varvel, shame on you for your racist views, and Mr. Taylor, you need to realize why this was so offensive and inappropriate, and try not to wallow in your privilege quite so much next time."

Dave Westra~www.vox.com~A cartoonist for the Indianapolis Star actually used a cartoon about Thanksgiving to bash immigrants.~http://www.vox.com/2014/11/22/7268597/this-tone-deaf-cartoonist-forgets-that-thanksgiving-is-about~I did not know much about the issue until the read this. I mostly ignored it because people were busy being angry about it, instead of offering a productive alternative. If you get overly angry about a topic, and stop loving thy neighbor in that anger, I stop listening.

But lets sum this up. Congress only gives deportation enough budget to deport 400k illegal immigrants a year. With 4.3 billion illegal immigrants, it would take 11 years to deport all illegal immigrants. This only works if no new illegal immigrants come over the border starting now.

Fun fact, not mentioned in this article but from a presentation I attended by a refugee organization, the amount of time it takes to legally become a citizen is also about the same amount of time it would take to deport all the illegal immigrants.

So, Obama's executive order essentially says that because we don't actually have the budget (which congress sets) to deport you, and if you can prove that you can add economic value to our country and/or have a legal family here and are not involved with anything else illegal, you can get legal status while you work on becoming a legal citizen.

This lessens the overwhelming burden of the grossly underfunded agencies that handle this. It only protects those who we want to attract anyways. If we truly believe in capitalism, and the people we keep here add to our economy, then jobs should grow. And it does not by any means protect anyone involved in drugs, sex trafficking, gangs, etc.

But honestly, you can disagree with me on most of this. That's fine. People should disagree politically. Whats gone in politics, especially shown in the media, is the respect. There is no respect anymore shown between people who disagree politically.

The main point that really makes the executive order make sense for me is that congress doesn't give enough budget to actually make any progress in the deportation department anyways. If you don't give enough budget to do what you're always complaining about, you've kind of lost the right to complain when someone does something, anything, about the issue. You have the system in place to handle it the way you want to, but you don't fund it.

I do not think the cartoon is a Racist cartoon . Are we so politically correct now on everything that, If you do , say, write  or God forbid draw a cartoon like this then you are racist. Do WE NOT have a sense of humor anymore?  This is the truth and reality of our lives today. YOU PEOPLE out there need to lighten up.
